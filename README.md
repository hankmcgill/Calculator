# CALCULATOR

## Introduction
This was my final project for The Odin Project's Foundations course.  We were asked to create a calculator from scratch using our own components and sense of design.

## Features
I wrote this app using vanilla JavaScript.  I decided to make my calculator an homage to the aesthetics of American Express cards and their branding (pro tip: try dividing by zero).
